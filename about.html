            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>Hi my name is Maddy Bolduc. I am a graphic designer currently studying at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I have been doing graphic design for four years. I went to Salem High School, which offered a tech program that allowed me to learn the Adobe suite in my junior and senior year of high school. I have my Adobe certificate as well as an award from Skills USA for my graphic design work.</p>
            <p>In my high school tech course, we would do work for people who requested it from outside the school. Students would create what the client requested, and the client would chose which student-created piece they wanted to use and make edits to it. A client selected my work, meaning I have a logo that I created being that is currently being used for an actual company. The logo I made was for New Hampshire Power washing and Lawn Care.</p>
            <p>During my time at Lesley, I have grown a lot and it shows throughout my work. My professors have pushed me to create things I never even knew I could do. I enjoy the challenge that being in college has been for me because when I get bored I am more complacent. If I am bored I know I will not be making my best work and I always want to put 110% effort in to everything I do. I am very proud of the work I have created here and I hope to continue making work that I am proud of.</p>
